## Usage

This educational website, dubbed Coeus after the Greek Titan of knowledge, is a wealth of information about four philsophical viewpoints, namely utilitarianism, stoicism, legalism, and feminism. The home page provides some basic info about the viewpoints, offering links to users where they can go to find out more about that particular viewpoint. Once they've properly studied, they can take a quiz (link at the bottom of the page), and test their knowledge of the viewpoint, as it pertains to corporate social responsibilty.
